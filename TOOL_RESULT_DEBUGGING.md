# Tool Result Flow Investigation

This document outlines the logging added to investigate why Claude Code doesn't show file edit results/diffs when using our Anthropic-to-OpenAI proxy.

## Added Logging

### 1. Conversation Analysis Logging
**Location**: `anthropicToOpenAI()` method  
**Trigger**: When processing conversations with tool_use or tool_result blocks  
**Output**: 
```
üîÑ Processing conversation with tools: {
  total_messages: 3,
  tool_use_messages: 1,
  tool_result_messages: 1,
  has_system: true,
  has_tools_defined: true
}
```

### 2. Tool Result Translation Logging
**Location**: `translateAnthropicMessage()` method  
**Trigger**: When translating tool_result blocks from Claude Code to OpenAI format  
**Output**:
```
üîß Translating tool_result block to OpenAI format: {
  tool_use_id: "toolu_123456",
  content_type: "string",
  content_length: 1250,
  content_preview: "Here's the result of running `cat -n` on /path/file.py...",
  is_error: false
}
```

### 3. OpenAI Response Analysis Logging
**Location**: `openAIToAnthropic()` method  
**Trigger**: When receiving responses from OpenAI  
**Output**:
```
üìù OpenAI response to tool results - content preview: 
I've successfully updated the file with the changes you requested. The modification adds error handling to the function...
```

### 4. Final Response Logging
**Location**: `openAIToAnthropic()` method  
**Trigger**: Before returning response to Claude Code  
**Output**:
```
üì§ Returning Anthropic response to Claude Code: {
  stop_reason: "end_turn",
  content_blocks: 1,
  has_text: true,
  has_tool_use: false,
  text_content_length: 425,
  response_preview: "I've successfully updated the file with the changes..."
}
```

## How to Use This for Debugging

1. **Start the proxy**: `npm run dev`
2. **Use Claude Code to make file edits**: Try a simple file edit operation
3. **Check the logs** for the following flow:
   - Initial request with tool definitions
   - Tool use request from Claude Code 
   - Tool result submission from Claude Code
   - OpenAI's response to the tool results
   - Final translated response back to Claude Code

## Expected vs Actual Behavior

### Expected (Direct Anthropic API):
- Claude requests file edit via tool_use
- User/Client executes tool and returns tool_result 
- Claude acknowledges the result with detailed response about what was changed

### What We Need to Verify:
- Are tool_result blocks being properly translated to OpenAI format?
- Is OpenAI providing substantive responses that acknowledge tool results?
- Are we correctly translating OpenAI's responses back to Anthropic format?
- Is the content reaching Claude Code in the expected format?

## Potential Issues to Look For:

1. **Empty/Missing Content**: OpenAI might not be generating responses that acknowledge tool results
2. **Format Issues**: Tool result content might be malformed when translated
3. **Model Behavior Differences**: OpenAI models might not provide the same level of tool result acknowledgment as Claude
4. **Streaming Issues**: Tool results might be handled differently in streaming vs non-streaming

## Next Steps:

Based on the logging output, we can identify:
- Where in the flow the acknowledgment is lost
- Whether the issue is translation, model behavior, or format
- If we need to modify prompts or add post-processing to enhance tool result acknowledgment
